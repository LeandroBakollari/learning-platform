# 📚 School Management System

## 📝 Project Description  

A learning platform is an integrated set of interactive online services that provide teachers, learners, and other individuals involved  in education with information, tools and resources to support and enhance educational delivery and management. 

This **School Management System** extends this concept by creating a dynamic, centralized environment where educational content, assessments, and performance insights are easily accessible. It promotes flexibility, allowing students to learn at their own pace while enabling educators to deliver and monitor lessons more effectively.
